# Book Galaxy Online Bookstore

## Introduction

A RESTful bookstore web application project called BookGalaxy. In the bookstore web app, you can shop the books through adding them to the shopping cart and checkout. The checkout page would require customer information such as name, address, phone, email and etc. It would validate the information based on its format. When hitting the complete purchase button, customer order information would be recorded to the database.
